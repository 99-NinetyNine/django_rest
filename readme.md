# Django React Project

This project is a simple web application that uses Django as the backend with a PostgreSQL database and React as the frontend. The API is documented using OpenAPI (Swagger). We are learning Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (with npm)
- PostgreSQL

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository, set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and configure the database:

   ```
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
   ```
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
   ```
   # Set up the Python virtual environment
   python -m venv env
   ```
   ```
   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
   ```
   # Install the required Python packages
   pip install -r r.txt
   ```
   ```
   # Set up PostgreSQL database
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
